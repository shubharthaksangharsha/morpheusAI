# Morpheus AI

A versatile AI assistant platform with a modern interface and multiple integrated tools, all controlled by an intelligent agent.

## Project Overview

Morpheus AI is a full-stack application that combines a sleek React frontend with a powerful backend to create an intuitive AI assistant experience. The platform features multiple specialized tools that the AI agent can control to assist users with various tasks.

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Frontend implementation complete
- ⏳ Backend in development

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into two main directories:

- `frontend/`: Contains the React application with the user interface
- `backend/`: Contains the backend services (in development)

## Frontend

The frontend is built with React, TypeScript, and Material-UI, providing a clean and responsive interface. It features:

- User chat interface for communicating with the AI
- Multiple agent-controlled tools in a tabbed interface:
  - Terminal
  - Web Browser
  - Code Editor
  - Task Planner
  - Tool Selection
  - Content Preview
- Responsive design with dark mode support

For detailed information about the frontend, see the [Frontend README](frontend/README.md).
